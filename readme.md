# Purchases App



My previous employer allowed me to take a few files from a full-stack app that handles in-app-purchases from various game apps. This app was built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS), and included a front end React app for viewing data in a dynamic data table.

### File Descriptions


#### _Backend_
**dboptions.js** - this file contains an express route for getting all possible unique options for fields, to display in a search dropdown on the frontend.<br/>
**service.js** - contains a few helpers for retrieving installs data from an external API.<br/>


#### _Frontend_
**DataTable.jsx** - component to display a dynamic data table.<br/>
**reducer.js** - redux reducer for the front end's search options.<br/>
